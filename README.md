## Abstract

Since the start of the new millennium, the use of social media has continued to grow at an increasing rate as people have found themselves with the capabilities to express themselves online in a way that allows expressing their feelings to others without having to feel confined to a social setting where it can feel restrictive to what they can say. As this increasing use of social media has followed for many years, it has also come with many people being able to express things with curse words and slurs that vary in degrees of severity and range in different categories as to what they mean by these words. With the use of data sets found on popular data websites, we were able to find that there many times, the inflammatory words used online were meant to be in a way that described anatomy. We also gathered that the more common words by themselves were often slurs or common curse words said even in a social setting. Inside this data, we also were able to determine that more often than not, these inflammatory words reach a rating that would be deemed as 'strong', which was our highest severity ratings category used to judge these words. This project argues that the increasing use of social media has allowed people not only to express themselves online but also be much more severe in their word usage without the constant pressure of social setting standards, often use these words to express a manner that is seen as more sexual demeanor as their common reason.
